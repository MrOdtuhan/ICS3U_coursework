1. Create a loop that will keep saying `"Hello"` every time someone enters a response of `"hi"` and will quit the loop if the user enters a response of `"bye"`.
The program will quit the loop and also say `"Goodbye!"`. Your program can assume that `hi` and `bye` are the only two values that will ever be entered. Example execution:
    ```
    Response: hi
    Hello
    Response: hi
    Hello
    Response: hi
    Hello
    Response: bye
    Goodbye!
    ```
    
2. Create a program that will take integers from the user in a loop. Use an accumulator variable to compute the total. The program will ask for 3 numbers, then display the total in a message.

3. **The Python Workbook, Exercise 61: Average**. In this exercise you will create a program that computes the average of a collection
of values entered by the user. The user will enter `0` as a sentinel value to indicate
that no further values will be provided. Your program should display an appropriate
error message if the first value entered by the user is `0`.
    > Hint: Because the `0` marks the end of the input it should not be included in the average.
