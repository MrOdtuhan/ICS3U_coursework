# Functions Assessment
1. Write the `return` statement for these functions

```python
def the_number_five():
    """This function returns the number five"""
    pass


def so_useful(a):
    """This function returns back whatever it was given."""
    pass


def add_two(a):
    """This function takes a number and adds two to it."""
    pass
```

2. Write the function definition (the first line starting with `def`) of the function being called below. Extra points for type-annotations. You do not have to create the function body, just the first line.

```python
say_hello("Dave")

sum_list([4, 2, 6, 7])

find_item_in_list("c", ["a", "b", "c"])
```

1. Create a function that takes a number and
returns that number *2
2. Create a function that takes a name and
returns a string saying "Hello, {name}!".
3. Create a function that takes a list
and returns a new list of only the non 
negative numbers.
