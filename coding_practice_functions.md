# Function Practice

- Define the function
- Define the parameters
- Return the result
- Call the function and *send* the **arguments**.
- Handle the return value by placing it in a variable. Print it out.

1. Create a function that takes three numbers and adds them together.
2. Create a function that takes a name and an age and returns a string message including both pieces of data.
3. Create a function that takes two numbers and returns the average of those numbers.
4. Create a function that takes three numbers and returns the largest (don't use `max`).
5. Create a function that takes a string and returns the first two characters.
